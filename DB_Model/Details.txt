This database model depicts a relational schema for a system managing orders, products, and units of measure (uom). Here's a breakdown of the entities and their relationships:

1. Orders Table
--Fields:
	1. order_id (INT): The primary key that uniquely identifies each order.
	2. customer_name (VARCHAR(100)): The name of the customer placing the order.
	3. total (DOUBLE): The total amount for the order.
	4. datetime (DATETIME): The date and time when the order was placed.
--Relationships:One order can have many items associated with it, connected through the order_details table (one-to-many relationship).

2. Order Details Table
--Fields:
	1. order_id (INT): A foreign key referencing the orders table, linking each order detail to an order.
	2. product_id (INT): A foreign key referencing the products table, linking the order detail to a specific product.
	3. quantity (DOUBLE): The quantity of the product ordered.
	4. total_price (DOUBLE): The total price for the quantity of the product ordered.

--Relationships:
	1. Connects the orders and products tables.
	2. Each order can include multiple products with varying quantities.

3. Products Table

--Fields:
	1. product_id (INT): The primary key that uniquely identifies each product.
	2. name (VARCHAR(100)): The name of the product.
	3. uom_id (INT): A foreign key referencing the uom (unit of measure) table.
	4. price_per_unit (DOUBLE): The price for one unit of the product.

--Relationships: Linked to the uom table to reference the unit of measure for the product.

4. UOM (Unit of Measure) Table

--Fields:
	1. uom_id (INT): The primary key that uniquely identifies each unit of measure.
	2. uom_name (VARCHAR(45)): The name of the unit of measure (e.g., kilogram, liter, piece).

--Relationships:Linked to the products table through uom_id. Each product can have one associated unit of measure.

5. Key Relationships and Connections

--Orders and Order Details: The order_details table acts as a junction table between orders and products, capturing the relationship of which products were included in an order and their respective quantities and prices.

--Products and UOM: Each product in the products table is associated with a unit of measure through the uom_id. This allows the system to know how a product is measured or sold.

6. Indexes
	1. All primary keys (order_id, product_id, uom_id) would likely have indexes for fast lookups.
	2. Foreign keys such as product_id in order_details and uom_id in products might also have indexes for efficient joins.

7. Use Case

This database structure is well-suited for managing orders in a retail context. It allows for:

1. Tracking customer orders.
2. Managing product inventories and prices.
3. Defining units of measure for different products.
4. Summing up order totals based on individual item prices and quantities.

This schema supports efficient querying for sales reports, inventory management, and customer purchase histories.
